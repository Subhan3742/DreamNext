        Dream Fans is one of the best quality manufacturers of electric fans in Pakistan. Our history is as vibrant and brilliant as our products themselves. We are proud to be the pioneer of manufacturing electric fan guards. The company started the production of fan guards back in 1951. The company started its operation under the leadership of Haji Muhammad Hussain, its founder. The setting of this project was a big achievement as at the time there were no facilities, assistance, or guidance. After great success in this challenge, he stepped forward to manufacture complete electric fans in 1962. After a complete success of this new unit under the name of Diamond Fans, he started unit no 2 under the name of Inayat Fans. Haji Inayat Ullah took on this new responsibility as a challenge, undeterred by the initial difficulties, and stuck to his motto "No Compromise on Quality." As a result of product innovation, exceptional quality, and distinct marketing strategies, his determined efforts were soon crowned with success, and Inayat Fans and Home Appliances became leading products in Pakistan and abroad. After the complete success of unit no 2, he started unit no 3 under the name of Dream Fans. Muhammad Sajid Mirza took on this new responsibility as a challenge, undeterred by the initial difficulties, and stuck to his motto "From Dream to Reality." As a result of product innovation, exceptional quality, and distinct marketing strategies, his determined efforts were soon crowned with success, and Dream Fans and Home Appliances became leading products in Pakistan. The direction of Dream Fans is highly qualified and motivated to lead the company. Muhammad Sajid Mirza is highly qualified and determined to maintain the unbeaten quality at every step, and that is the reason Dream Fans is famous around the country.
